# Setup
To get started:\
In the bash shell type the following:
```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/manisjp/Platformer.git
```
This **creates** a folder in which all the files are located. Next, enter that folder:
```sh
    $ cd Platformer
```

```sh
	$ gem install
```
Now to **run** the code:
```sh
    $ ruby main.rb
```
> There are only two controls to the game. The left and right arrow keys will move the player left and right respectively.
> Collect as many fish as possible. The fish can only be collected through the penguins mouth.
> If the player falls too low, the game will end.
